# CSS Gallery

Make a complete HTML page looking like the design below on desktop.

Unfortunately, the designer was very busy and did not have time to finalize the mobile layout. But the specification says that the mobile view should show only one image per row (like Instagram.)

Note that the links to "view" & "buy" do not need to do anything.

The CSS should be crafted with:

* A *mobile first* approach.
* Consideration for different browsers' compatibility. We want you to support Internet Explorer 11 as well as modern browsers such as Chrome and Safari.
* A consistent naming convention and code style.

You may use:

* Any CSS standard you find suitable.
* More than one CSS file, but make sure no build step is required.
* Photos from https://picsum.photos.

You may **not**:

* Use Bootstrap, jQuery or similar.
* Create a blinking monster!

In you Google Drive, we want you to submit:

* One folder with the name `cssGallery`.
* Inside that folder, your `index.html` file.
* Also inside that folder, your CSS file(s).

Good luck!

As always, submit your code to the Google Drive no later than Monday 9am.
